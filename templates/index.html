              <p>Consider yourself a bit of a boffin when it comes to Premier League trivia? There are many football fans who could tell you off the top of their head which team has the longest unbeaten run in 
                 Premier League history (Arsenal), or who holds the record for the most Premier League golden boots (Thierry Henry, of Arsenal).
              </p> 
              <p>But what about the less desirable accomplishments that the players, managers and fans would rather keep under wraps? 
                 Put your Premier League trivia knowledge to the test as we quiz you on some of the most obscure and unwanted records in the history of the Premier League.
