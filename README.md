# Unwanted Premier League records quiz

### This is a football trivia quiz, developed within the Flask framework using Python.
### It allows the user to enter a username, before asking them 15 multiple choice questions.
### The quiz contains a function which counts the user's score, before displaying it on a leaderboard upon completion of the quiz.

## Technologies used

### Python was used to write the underlying code, including all functions, routes and logic.
### The project was built inside the Flask framework, which helped display the output from the Python logic.
### The website was built upon a Bootstrap template found online.
### HTML and CSS (see 'style.css') were used to enhance the structure and appearance of the website.
### jQuery was used to enhance aspects of the game - specifically by revealing the answer options to the user through a slidedown function on click (see 'script.js').
### Each page also includes sticky social media sidebars, instructions on how to create which were found online.

## Testing

### Both automated and manual tests were conducted to ensure that certain features worked. 
### These can be found in the 'unittests' folder. 
### Manual tests were created to make sure that the 'lowercase' and 'strip' functions worked alone and in tandem. 
### The number sorting function was tested using unittesting.
